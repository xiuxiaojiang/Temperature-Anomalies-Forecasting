# Data Analyst Project: Temperature Anomalies Forecasting

The project aims to analyze the temperature anomalies in the northern hemisphere from 1850 to 2021 using a time-series dataset. The temperature changes are important for the environment, and it's crucial to analyze them to understand how they will change over time and implement strategies to accommodate such changes.

Time series modeling: ARIMA model and ARMA model

Results: ARIMA(3,1,0) model can predict the year from 2016 to 2021 well. All predicted values are inside of the 95% confident interval.
